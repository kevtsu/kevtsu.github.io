<h2>List Sharing</h2><br/>
Placemaker allows you to share lists with other users.  Other users can view and copy the list, but they cannot edit the list.  To share the list:<br/>
 
<p>1. Tap on “Start Sharing”.  You will be asked to Sign In using either Google or email + password. This is how PlaceMaker knows that you are the owner of the list and can edit the list. Whenever you make changes to the list, other users will see the changes in PlaceMaker on their device.</p>
<p>2. Choose either “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with email”. If you Sign in with email, you will need to enter a password for your account.</p>
<p>3. The PlaceMaker app will upload the list to the cloud.</p>
<p>4. To share the list, the other user must have PlaceMaker installed and click on the PlaceMaker sharing link.</p>
<p>5. After you sign in, you can send the link one of three ways:<br/>
a.     Messages – starts a new message with a sharing link and PlaceMaker installation link.<br/>
b.     Mail – starts a new email with a sharing link, PlaceMaker installation link and the list as a table in the email.<br/>
c.     Clipboard – copies the sharing link and installation link to the clipboard and you can paste it into any application.</p>
