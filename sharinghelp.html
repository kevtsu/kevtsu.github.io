<p>1. Tap on “Start Sharing”.  You will be asked to Sign In using either Google or email + password. This is how PlaceMaker knows that you are the owner of the list and can edit the list. Whenever you make changes to the list, other users will see the changes in PlaceMaker on their device.</p>
<p>2. Choose either “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with email”. If you Sign in with email, you will need to enter a password for your account.</p>
<p>3. The PlaceMaker app will upload the list to the cloud.</p>
