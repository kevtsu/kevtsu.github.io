<h2>CSV Import</h2><br/>
Placemaker allows you to import CSV lists.  These lists can be created by Numbers, Excel or other programs.  Each entry must include the address to be added to the list.  PlaceMaker will geocode (assign a latitude and longitude location) to each address in a batch process during the import process.  After geocoding, the list is imported and can be manually modified or optimized (with a subscription).<br/>
Free users and Up to 25 stops subscribers can import lists with up to 5 stops.  Up to 150 and Over 150 subscribers can import lists of up to 250 stops.<br/>
Instructions:
<p>1. Tap on “Start Sharing”.  You will be asked to Sign In using either Google or email + password. This is how PlaceMaker knows that you are the owner of the list and can edit the list. Whenever you make changes to the list, other users will see the changes in PlaceMaker on their device.</p>
<p>2. Choose either “Sign in with Google” or “Sign in with email”. If you Sign in with email, you will need to enter a password for your account.</p>
<p>3. The PlaceMaker app will upload the list to the cloud.</p>
<p>4. To share the list, the other user must have PlaceMaker installed and click on the PlaceMaker sharing link.</p>
<p>5. After you sign in, you can send the link one of three ways:<br/>
a.     Messages – starts a new message with a sharing link and PlaceMaker installation link.<br/>
b.     Mail – starts a new email with a sharing link, PlaceMaker installation link and the list as a table in the email.<br/>
c.     Clipboard – copies the sharing link and installation link to the clipboard and you can paste it into any application.</p>
